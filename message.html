                <h3 id="up">Python</h3>
                <p id="down">
                    Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language
                    that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore
                    Python skills are in high demand
                </p>
                <h3 id="up1">JavaScript</h3>
                <p id="down1">JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before
                    a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. </p>
                <h3 id="up2">Java</h3>
                <p id="down2"> Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that
                    an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.</p>
                <h3 id="up3">c</h3>
                <p id="down3">Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program, Gorton says. As one of the first programming languages ever developed, C has served as the foundation for writing more modern languages such as Python,
                    Ruby, and PHP. </p>
